2. This will populate the text area with sample data
3. **Modify** the template with your actual ingredients
4. **Add more rows** as needed

#### **Step 3: Paste Your Data**

### **5. CSV Best Practices**

#### **‚úÖ Do's:**
- Use quotes around text values: `"Almond Milk"`
- Use consistent decimal places: `25.0` not `25`
- Use unique SKUs: `ALM-MILK-001`, `ALM-MILK-002`
- Include header row (column names)
- Test with small batches first

#### **‚ùå Don'ts:**
- Don't use commas in text values without quotes
- Don't skip the header row
- Don't use duplicate SKUs
- Don't mix units (stick to ml, g, pieces)
- Don't forget to save as CSV format

### **6. Common Categories**

| Category | Examples | Typical Units |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| `milk` | Almond, Oat, Whole, Soy | ml ‚Üí shot |
| `coffee` | Beans, Ground, Instant | g ‚Üí shot |
| `syrup` | Vanilla, Caramel, Chocolate | ml ‚Üí pump |
| `sweetener` | Sugar, Honey, Maple | g/ml ‚Üí tsp |
| `topping` | Whipped Cream, Sprinkles | ml/g ‚Üí dollop |
| `spice` | Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Cardamom | g ‚Üí sprinkle |

### **7. Conversion Rate Examples**

| Ingredient | Actual Unit | Display Unit | Conversion Rate | Example |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Almond Milk | ml | shot | 25.0 | 1000ml = 40 shots |
| Coffee Beans | g | shot | 18.0 | 5000g = 277.78 shots |
| Vanilla Syrup | ml | pump | 15.0 | 1000ml = 66.67 pumps |
| Sugar | g | tsp | 4.0 | 2000g = 500 tsp |
| Whipped Cream | ml | dollop | 30.0 | 1000ml = 33.33 dollops |

### **8. Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Errors:**

**"Missing required fields"**
- Check that all required columns are filled
- Ensure SKU is unique
- Verify conversion rate is a number

**"Duplicate SKU"**
- Each ingredient needs a unique SKU
- Use format: `CATEGORY-NAME-001`

**"Invalid CSV format"**
- Check for missing quotes around text
- Ensure proper comma separation
- Verify header row is present

**"Processing failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Try with fewer ingredients first
- Verify all numbers are valid

### **9. Sample Files**

#### **Download Sample CSV:**
- **File**: `backend/sample-bulk-ingredients.csv`
- **Contains**: 18 common coffee shop ingredients
- **Ready to use**: Just modify quantities and SKUs
